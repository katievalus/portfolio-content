        Hi! My name is Katie Valus. Welcome to my lifestyle page. I am excited to share with you my lifestyle, hobbies, 
        favorite recepies, workouts, and more about my life. I am currently a student at the University of Michigan. I was born 
        and raised in Connecticut, and love the east coast.

    <p>
        I have 2 brothers and amazing parents. It was hard to leave my family and come to college after I graduated highschool in 2020. Luckily,
        I have amazing friends who made the transition easy. I love spending time with my friends. I have so many fond memories with my friends 
        that I cant wait to share on this blog.
