    <h1>My Faovrite Recipes</h1>
    <p>I love to cook! Over the last couple months I have had fun playing with recipes for some of my favorite foods and 
        making them healthier. For my adapted recepies, such as the brownies, I am sure you will not be able to tell the difference
        between a real and a black bean brownie they are so good! Other recepies I have included are staples that I always have in my 
        fridge. Enjoy!

        <li>1/4 cup of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2/3 cup of non dairy chocolate chips (my favorite brand
            is EnjoyLife)

        <li>preheat the overn to 350 F</li>
        <li>combine all ingredients in a food processor and 
            blend very well. This may take a few minuets, the smoother

        <li>Pot into an 8x8 greased pan</li>
        <li>add extra chocolate chips to the top of the batter
            for decoration

        <li>My faovirte way to eat these is after letting them sit in the 
            freezer for 15-20 minetes after they have cooled, then 
            keeping them in the fridge to eat later.

            herbs, and salt.

        <li>Compine in a bowl and add pumpkin seeds to the top! I like to dress with tahini-siracha dressing.</li>
