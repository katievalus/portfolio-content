    <h1>Workouts</h1>
    <h2>Peloton</h2>
    <p>Staying active is the key part of a healthy lifestyle. Growing up as a gymnast and field hockey player, I was always aactive.
        When these sports ended for me, I didn't know how to stay in shape. I tried many workouts but stuggled finding one that I loved. In 2020, 
        I got a peloton. This purchase changed my life! Cycling is my go to workout, a great way to do cardio and build muscle. There are so many classes
        to choose from and I always end up having a great workout. </p>

    <h2>Solidcore</h2>
        <p>Another big part of my workout routine is pilates. I discovered pilates this past summer,
        and I am obsessed. My studio is [solidcore], where I talk classes in CT and MI. This workout will leave you sore for days, and I've never 
        taken a class that actually shows results! </p>
